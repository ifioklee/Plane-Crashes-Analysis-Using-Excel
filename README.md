# Plane-Crashes-Analysis-Using-Excel
# Project Overview
This repository contains a dashboard creating from analyzing 5,268 plane crash data from 1908 - 2009 using Microsoft Excel. It provides insigght into the number of aircraft crashes that has occured in 101 years, explores patterns relating to fatalities as a result of these incidents.

# Goal
Plane crashes have been happenening for over a hundred years since it invention by Wright brothers in 1903, on hearing the news of Air India crash involving a 12 year old Boeing 787 aircraft on Thurday 12th June 2025, I wanted to explore data aroud this occurance, provide insight into and analyse patterns relating to plane crashes. 
The main objective was to create a dashboard that will provide information about these insights and patterns.

# Features
- Chart visulaizaations for showing parttern of total number of plane crashes, total number of fatalities and total number of survivors in the time frame under  investigation.
- A dashboard showing an overview of insights and pattern as a result of analytic process carried out on data.
- Pivot tables used in creating chart visulizations.
- Cleaned dataset that serve as basis for creating pivot tables, chart visulizations, mathematical calculations and dashboard.

# Data
This project uses data on plane crashes downloaded from open source platform [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/airplane-crashes) spanning from 1908-2009. Data includes date, time, location, operator, flight number, route, type, registration, number aboard, fatalities, summary of cause of plane crash.
